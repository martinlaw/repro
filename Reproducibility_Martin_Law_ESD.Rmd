# Learning outcomes

### What is meant by "reproducibility"
### Barriers to reproducibility
### Solutions to those barriers
 
---

# To begin: What do you understand by the term "reproducible research"?

--

# Why is reproducible research important?


---



# Definitions

"The term **reproducible research** refers to the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data and **making the full dataset and the code to calculate the results easily accessible**." `--` Wikipedia (therefore correct).


--

"**Reproducible research** refers to the practice of ensuring that the results of scientific studies or experiments can be independently verified by other researchers. It involves **documenting and providing all the necessary data, code, and methodology used** in a study **so that others can replicate the analysis** and obtain similar results." `--` ChatGPT (therefore even more correct)

---

# Definitions in the literature

Reproducible: "Authors provide all the necessary data and the computer codes to run the analysis again, re-creating the results." [Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1822162), via [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions) (accessed Feb 2024)

Computational reproducibility: "obtaining consistent results using the same **input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis**" `--` [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25303/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science), via [Essawy et al.,2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104753)

Two articles from *Biostatistics*, a journal that takes reproducibility seriously (recommended on [Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/13576/38282)):


Personally recommended by the journal's Associate Editor for Reproducibility:

###[Air pollution and health in Scotland: a multicity study, Lee et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp010)

And the other paper linked to in the answer:

###[Testing SNPs and sets of SNPs for importance in association studies, Schwender et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq042)



<!-- A third article from *Biostatistics*: -->

<!-- ###[Adaptive clinical trial designs with blinded selection of binary composite endpoints and sample size reassessment, Bofill Roig et al. (Section 5)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxac040) -->

# Barrier: Multiple versions of code and/or data

## Solution: Version control (e.g. github)

Version control is a way to track code changes over time without saving multiple versions of your code.

---

---

# Why use version control?

 - Can use multiple machines without stress
 - Can collaborate with others and see all their changes
 - Can revert back to an older version in case of disaster
 
--

## The Terminology

 - **git**: a version control system;
 - **repository/repo**: a set of files that you are using version control on; 
 - **github**: a website/hosting service for your repos (like Dropbox but better);
 - **commit**: a version/snapshot of your repo that you create, with a corresponding message that you write;
 - **push**: to send ("push"!) the current version of your repo from your computer ("local") to the hosting service ("remote")
 - **pull**: to download ("pull"!) the remote version of your repo from the hosting service to your computer.

---

# How to set up version control (intially)

Short version: walk through the instructions on [Happy git With R](https://happygitwithr.com)

Less short version:

 - Sign up to [github](https://github.com/)
 - Download and install git (you may have it already) ([Chapter 6](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git))
 - Introduce yourself to git ([Chapter 7](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git))
 - Set up a Personal Access Token ([Chapter 9](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat))
 - Connect R Studio to git/github ([Chapter 12](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github))
 

--

# How to set up version control (single project in R)

 - Create a new repo in github
 - Create a new project in R Studio, cloned from the github **repo**

---

# Using version control once it's set up

 - Make changes to your code
 - **Commit** them, adding a descriptive message
 - **Push** the committed changes from the local (computer) repo to the remote (github) repo

---

# Barriers and Solutions

```{r, echo=F}
barriers1 <- barriers
barriers1$Solution[2:6] <- ("")
knitr::kable(barriers1, format = 'html')
```

---

# Barrier: Copying results from R to separate manuscript

Often, only analysis in R, all results written up in LaTeX or Word.

After any changes:

 - Need to copy & paste tables from one program to another.
 - Need to insert or email figures generated by R.
 - Need to update every relevant reference to results in the text, e.g. descriptive statistics, point estimates, CIs, simulation study results


---

### Solution: Dynamic document generation

Use R Markdown (or Quarto)! R Markdown is for R only. Quarto is for R, Julia and Python (and more in future).

Output is always up to date. 

All references in text are automatically updated.

If working with non-statisticians, can still use this approach and send resulting HTML file to collaborators: they see the updated text and can save the updated figures.

Can even create manuscripts directly (using `rticles` package in R Markdown or templates in quarto).

---

# Using R Markdown

# Barriers and Solutions

```{r, echo=F}
barriers2 <- barriers
barriers2$Solution[3:6] <- ("")
knitr::kable(barriers2, format = 'html')
```


---

# Barrier: problematic use of file paths in code

---

---

# Barrier: problematic use of file paths in code

## Why?

To tell R where to load a file from (or save a file to), you must specify the location relative to the current *working directory*. But specifying the working directory (or any load/save location) as in the previous slide will cause problems:

 - The code will not run for anyone else
 - The code will not run for the same author on a different machine
 - The code may not run for the same author in a year or two
 
---

## Solution: R Projects and `here()`

Use **Projects** in R: when your scripts are part of a Project in R, the working directory will (almost) always be the folder containing the Project file and subfolders, independent of who opens the Project and the computer they're using.
<!-- Then there is no ambiguity on the working directory. -->

Minor remaining problem:
 - When rendering R Markdown (Rmd) files, R Studio takes the working directory to be be the same folder as the Rmd file (rather than the location of the Project file);
    - Worse, this can cause a mismatch whereby code runs fine in the console but not in the Rmd file (or vice versa);
 - Can be confusion over forward (`/`) or backward (`\`) slashes and whether you need one or two of them.

---

## Solution: R Projects and `here()`

The `here()` command (from the `here` package):
 - lets you specify file paths without slashes;
 - "knows" where the working directory should be.

--

Running `here()` will return the path to the working directory, e.g.

```
here()
## [1] C:/Users/Martin/talks/repro/
```

Arguments inside `here()` will be appended to this path, e.g.

```
here("figs", "on-fire.jpg")
## [1] C:/Users/Martin/talks/repro/figs/on-fire.jpg
```

---

# Barriers and Solutions

```{r, echo=F}
barriers3 <- barriers
barriers3$Solution[4:6] <- ("")
knitr::kable(barriers3, format = 'html')
```

---

# Barrier: Unclear order of actions/running scripts

--

## (Very simple) Solution: use a single R Markdown document

---

## (Simple) Solution: number and name your scripts; use README file; create "do everything" file

### Scripts

Label scripts, e.g. `00-load.R`, `10-clean.R`, `20-analyse.R`, `30-create-figures.R`.

Filenames should be clear. Increments of 10 allow you to add more files later.

### README.md

In github, repos can be created with a README file, which is rendered on the repo page.

Use this to explain to others (and to yourself!) what the code does and how to reproduce the results.

---

## (Simple) Solution: number and name your scripts; use README file; create "do everything" file

### "do everything" file

Create a file that runs all the required files in order, e.g.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
source(00-load.R)
source(10-clean.R)
source(20-analyse.R)
source(30-create-figures.R)
```

---

## (Complex) Solution: create a pipeline (not a pipe!)

*"In computing, a pipeline, also known as a data pipeline, is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one."*

If the workflow is complex or takes a long time.

Still a file that does everything, called a *makefile*, but also only runs the parts that have (data or code) changed.

Simplest R package: `makeit`. 

Example code:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
make("analysis.R", "input.dat", "output.dat")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
make("01_model.R", "data.dat", "results.dat")
make("02_plots.R", "results.dat", c("plots/A.png", "plots/B.png"))
make("03_tables.R", "results.dat", c("tables/A.csv", "tables/B.csv"))
```

---

## (Complex) Solution: create a pipeline (not a pipe!)

A more popular (though complex) R package for piplines: `targets`.

These packages are for R, but many software agnostic solutions exist (e.g. `Make`).

---

# Barriers and Solutions

```{r, echo=F}
barriers4 <- barriers
barriers4$Solution[5:6] <- ("")
knitr::kable(barriers4, format = 'html')
```

---

# Barrier: Unclear software dependencies

--

## Solution in 3 parts: `renv` and Docker (and Nikita!)

--

### Part 1: `renv`

`renv` ("**r**eproducible **env**ironment") is an R package that helps make R projects reproducible.

When you set up renv in an R project (command `renv::init()`), it makes a list of the packages (and versions) used in that project.

When you (or someone else) opens the project on another computer, renv can be used to download and install those packages (`renv::restore()`).

To update the list of packages your project needs: `renv::snapshot()`.

To update your packages to the latest versions: `renv::update()`.

--

Sometimes identical R code can give different results on different operating systems. In this case, we need more tools...

### Solution: publish your code on the Open Science Framework (OSF)

#### What is the OSF?

*The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a tool that promotes open, centralized workflows by enabling capture of different aspects and products of the research lifecycle, including developing a research idea, designing a study, storing and analyzing collected data, and writing and publishing reports or papers.* -- [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370619/)

####  What is available on OSF:

 - Preregistration
 - Project
 - Preprint

---
 
*Preregistration:*

 - Upload a research plan: research question, planned analyses, etc.
 - Snapshot/frozen (original always visible)
 - Updates can be made as new "versions"
 - Can be private, public, embargoed or shared with only certain people.
 - DOI

--

*Project:*

 - Upload any kind of files
 - Can be sync'd with github repo (and other sources) -- changes are instant
 - Can be used with R directly (create folders, upload files, etc.)
 - Public/private/shared with collaborators
 - DOI
 
--

*Preprint:*

 - Updates can be made as new "versions"
 - DOI
 
 
<!-- #### What else? -->

<!--  - Available forever ("persistent") -->
<!--  - DOIs everywhere -->
<!--  - Institutions can have their own page -->
