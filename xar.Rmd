# To begin: What do you understand by the term "reproducible research"?

--

# Why is reproducible research important?

---

# Definitions

"The term **reproducible research** refers to the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data and *making the full dataset and the code* to calculate the results easily accessible." `--` Wikipedia (therefore correct).


--

"**Reproducible research** refers to the practice of ensuring that the results of scientific studies or experiments can be independently verified by other researchers. It involves *documenting and providing all the necessary data, code, and methodology used* in a study so that others can replicate the analysis and obtain similar results." `--` ChatGPT (therefore even more correct)

# Definitions in the literature


Reproducible: "Authors provide all the necessary data and the computer codes to run the analysis again, re-creating the results." [Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1822162), via [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions) (accessed Feb 2024)

Computational reproducibility: "obtaining consistent results using the same *input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis*" `--` [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25303/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science), via [Essawy et al.,2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104753)

The research, from *Biostatistics*:

Two articles (recommended on [Stack Exchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/13576/38282)):

###[Testing SNPs and sets of SNPs for importance in association studies, Schwender et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq042)

###[Air pollution and health in Scotland: a multicity study, Lee et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp010)

A third article from *Biostatistics*:

###[Adaptive clinical trial designs with blinded selection of binary composite endpoints and sample size reassessment, Bofill Roig et al. (Section 5)](https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxac040)

# Barriers to reproducibility

### Multiple versions of code and/or data
### Code: problematic use of file paths 
### Copying results from R to separate manuscript
### Unclear order of running scripts
### Unclear software dependencies
### Your code gets lost forever
