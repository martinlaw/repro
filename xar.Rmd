# To begin: What do you understand by the term "reproducible research"?

--

# Why is reproducible research important?


---



# Definitions

"The term **reproducible research** refers to the idea that scientific results should be documented in such a way that their deduction is fully transparent. This requires a detailed description of the methods used to obtain the data and *making the full dataset and the code* to calculate the results easily accessible." `--` Wikipedia (therefore correct).


--

"**Reproducible research** refers to the practice of ensuring that the results of scientific studies or experiments can be independently verified by other researchers. It involves *documenting and providing all the necessary data, code, and methodology used* in a study so that others can replicate the analysis and obtain similar results." `--` ChatGPT (therefore even more correct)

---

# Definitions in the literature


Reproducible: "Authors provide all the necessary data and the computer codes to run the analysis again, re-creating the results." [Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1822162), via [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions#rr-overview-definitions) (accessed Feb 2024)

Computational reproducibility: "obtaining consistent results using the same *input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis*" `--` [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25303/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science), via [Essawy et al.,2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104753)

# Barriers to reproducibility

### Multiple versions of code and/or data
### Code: problematic use of file paths 
### Copying results from R to separate manuscript
### Unclear order of running scripts
### Unclear software dependencies
### Your code gets lost forever

# Barriers and Solutions
```{r, echo=F}
barriers <- data.frame(Barrier=c("Multiple versions of code and/or data",
                                  "Copying results from R to separate manuscript",

barriers.only$Solution <- ("")
knitr::kable(barriers.only, format = 'html')
```

# Barrier: Multiple versions of code and/or data

## Solution: Version control (e.g. github)

Version control is a way to track code changes over time without saving multiple versions of your code.

---

# Why use version control?

 - Can use multiple machines without stress
 - Can collaborate with others and see all their changes
 - Can revert back to an older version in case of disaster
 
---

# How to set up version control (intially)

Short version: walk through the instructions on [Happy git With R](https://happygitwithr.com)

Less short version:

 - Sign up to [github](https://github.com/)
 - Download and install git (you may have it already) ([Chapter 6](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git))
 - Introduce yourself to git ([Chapter 7](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git))
 - Set up a Personal Access Token ([Chapter 9](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat))
 - Connect R Studio to git/github ([Chapter 12](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github))
 

--

# How to set up version control (single project in R)

 - Create a new repo in github
 - Create a new project in R Studio, cloned from the github **repo**

---

# Using version control once it's set up

 - Make changes to your code
 - **Commit** them, adding a descriptive message
 - **Push** the committed changes from the local (computer) repo to the remote (github) repo

---

# Barriers and Solutions

```{r, echo=F}
barriers1 <- barriers
barriers1$Solution[2:6] <- ("")
knitr::kable(barriers1, format = 'html')
```

---

# Barrier: Copying results from R to separate manuscript

All analysis in R, all results written up in LaTeX or Word. After any changes:

Need to copy & paste tables from one program to another.

Need to insert or email figures generated by R.

Need to update every relevant reference to results in the text, e.g. descriptive statistics, point estimates, CIs, simulation study results


---

### Solution: Dynamic document generation

Use R Markdown (or quarto)!

Output is always up to date. 

All references in text are automatically updated.

If working with non-statisticians, can still use this approach and send resulting HTML file to collaborators: they see the updated text and can save the updated figures.

Can even create manuscripts directly (using `rticles` package in R Markdown or templates in quarto).

---

# Using R Markdown

# Barriers and Solutions

```{r, echo=F}
barriers2 <- barriers
barriers2$Solution[3:6] <- ("")
knitr::kable(barriers2, format = 'html')
```

# Barrier: problematic use of file paths in code

---

# Barrier: problematic use of file paths in code

## Why?

To tell R where to load a file from (or save a file to), you must specify the location relative to the current *working directory*. But specifying the working directory (or any load/save location) as in the previous slide will cause problems:

 - The code will not run for anyone else
 - The code will not run for the same author on a different machine
 - The code may not run for the same author in a year or two
 
---

## Solution: R Projects and here()


Use **Projects** in R: when your scripts are part of a Project in R, the working directory will (almost) always be the folder containing all the Project files and subfolders, whoever opens the Project and whatever machine they're using.
<!-- Then there is no ambiguity on the working directory. -->

Remaining problem:
 - R Markdown (Rmd) files take the working directory to be be the same folder as the Rmd file.
 - You need to remember whether you need forward (`/`) or backward (`\`) slashes and whether you need one or two of them.

---

## Solution: `here()`

The `here()` command (from the `here` package):
 - lets you specify file paths without slashes;
 - "knows" where the working directory should be.

--

Running `here()` will return the path to the working directory, e.g.

```
here("figs", "on-fire.jpg")
## [1] C:/Users/Martin/talks/repro/ 
```

Arguments inside `here()` will be appended to this path, e.g.

```
here("figs", "on-fire.jpg")
## [1] C:/Users/Martin/talks/repro/figs/on-fire.jpg
```

### Solution: publish your code on the Open Science Framework (OSF)

#### What is the OSF?

*The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a tool that promotes open, centralized workflows by enabling capture of different aspects and products of the research lifecycle, including developing a research idea, designing a study, storing and analyzing collected data, and writing and publishing reports or papers.* -- [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370619/)

####  What is available on OSF:

 - Preregistration
 - Project
 - Preprint

---
 
*Preregistration:*

 - Upload a research plan: research question, planned analyses, etc.
 - DOI
 - Snapshot/frozen (original always visible)
 - Updates can be made as new "versions"
 - Can be private, public, embargoed or shared with only certain people.

-- 

*Project:*

 - Upload any kind of files
 - Can be sync'd with github repo (and other sources) -- changes are instant
 - Can be used with R directly (create folders, upload files, etc.)
 - Public/private/shared with collaborators
 - DOI
 
--

*Preprint:*

 - Updates can be made as new "versions"
 - DOI
 
 
<!-- #### What else? -->

<!--  - Available forever ("persistent") -->
<!--  - DOIs everywhere -->
<!--  - Institutions can have their own page -->
